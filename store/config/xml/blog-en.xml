								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">Order rules are a robust and powerful tool for automating your store’s order processing workflow. However, it may be overwhelming to create your own order rules from scratch if you don’t have prior experience with automation. To help you get started, we’ve compiled a list of suggested order rules to unlock the full potential of NS8.</p>
<p align="left">These blanket rules are designed to apply to a wide variety of merchants, but you may wish to tweak them slightly to suit your individual needs. And remember that order rules run sequentially from top to bottom, so maintaining a logical structure is essential.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_nufr5kd1yusb"></a>1. Positive list</h3>
<p align="left"><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4117" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list.png" alt="NS8 Positive list" width="1533" height="795" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-200x104.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-300x156.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-400x207.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-600x311.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-768x398.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-800x415.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list-1200x622.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01_positive_list.png 1533w" sizes="(max-width: 1533px) 100vw, 1533px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">The first order rule to incorporate into your automation workflow is a positive list: namely, a list of VIP customers whose orders will be auto-approved. Placing this order rule at the top of your rule hierarchy ensures that these orders won’t be affected by any subsequent rules. Generally, this list should be restricted to well-known good customers who have had their legitimate orders mistakenly flagged in the past. We also recommend building a price cap into your positive list to prevent issues with account takeover fraud.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_hcczthr6lufw"></a>2. Negative list</h3>
<p align="left"><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4118" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list.png" alt="NS8 Negative List" width="1570" height="644" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-200x82.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-300x123.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-400x164.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-600x246.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-768x315.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-800x328.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-1024x420.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list-1200x492.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02_negative_list.png 1570w" sizes="(max-width: 1570px) 100vw, 1570px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">In contrast to your positive list, a negative list order rule lists any customers whose orders should be automatically cancelled. These known bad actors can be singled out through their name, email address, IP address, or any other unique identifiers. If you have had recurring issues with certain customers placing bad or fraudulent orders, isolating these infamous users in a negative list will prevent them from wasting your precious time and resources in the future. Note that this list can be updated anytime to keep up with changing fraud threats.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_vd0sdira8i3u"></a>3. Billing/shipping mismatch</h3>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4120" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch.png" alt="Billing and Shipping Match" width="991" height="412" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch-200x83.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch-300x125.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch-400x166.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch-600x249.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch-768x319.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch-800x333.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/03_bill_ship_mismatch.png 991w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Our next recommended order rule looks for discrepancies between a customer’s billing address and shipping address, as this can be a sign of fraudulent activity. For example, if a hacker places an expensive order using illegally-obtained credit card information, they will likely send the purchase to their own shipping address while using the cardholder’s real billing address. However, not all orders with mismatched billing and shipping addresses are fraudulent. Some customers, like college students, may live at one address but have bills sent to another, and other customers may be sending a gift to a friend. We recommend building a price threshold or other fraud indicator into this order rule to prevent legitimate customers from being flagged.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_ao87pugrwr1x"></a>4. IP mismatch</h3>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4121" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP.png" alt="location ip" width="1557" height="637" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-200x82.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-300x123.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-400x164.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-600x245.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-768x314.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-800x327.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-1024x419.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP-1200x491.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04_location_IP.png 1557w" sizes="(max-width: 1557px) 100vw, 1557px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">A user’s IP address can be used to triangulate the country from which their session originates. If this country does not match the country listed in their billing or shipping address, this may be a major red flag for fraudulent activity. An order rule that detects IP mismatches will ensure that these orders are flagged as high-risk to allow for further review. For some merchants, an IP mismatch may not be unusual (for example, if a large portion of your customer base is comprised of people who frequently travel abroad), so this order rule may require adjustment.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_eto9qwow796u"></a>5. Location</h3>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4122" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location.png" alt="NS8 Location" width="1560" height="641" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-200x82.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-300x123.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-400x164.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-600x247.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-768x316.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-800x329.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-1024x421.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location-1200x493.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05_location.png 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Location-based order rules function much like negative list rules that screen individual users, but these rules are designed to quarantine orders based on their location. This may be useful if you notice an influx of bad orders from a specific area or have issues with shipping forwarders to certain regions. However, we recommend adjusting the risk level of these orders rather than canceling them outright—that way, you can take the time to manually review the details of each order and approve any legitimate purchases from these locations.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_niedutl6fb20"></a>6. Price (high risk)</h3>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4123" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high.png" alt="NS8 Price" width="1560" height="528" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-200x68.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-300x102.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-400x135.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-600x203.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-768x260.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-800x271.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-1024x347.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high-1200x406.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06_price_high.png 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Unexpectedly large purchases may sound exciting, but they are often harbingers of fraud rather than legitimate business. We recommend building an order rule that elevates an order’s risk level if the purchase price exceeds a certain threshold. This specific threshold will vary between merchants and is based on your store’s prices, products, and clientele. Roughly speaking, any order total higher than double the price of an average order should be flagged as high-risk and subject to additional review.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_t7enn66q2fuk"></a>7. Price (verify)</h3>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4124" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify.png" alt="NS8 Price Verify" width="1556" height="525" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-200x67.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-300x101.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-400x135.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-600x202.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-768x259.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-800x270.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-1024x346.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify-1200x405.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/07_price_verify.png 1556w" sizes="(max-width: 1556px) 100vw, 1556px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Other purchases may still be large enough to warrant suspicion, but not quite as large as in the previous scenario. Creating an order rule that subjects these moderately large purchases to additional friction (using NS8’s Customer Verification process) can ensure that they are legitimate. Depending on how you have configured your Customer Verification settings in NS8, the order may be automatically approved if the check is successful. A good threshold for this order rule is to initiate verification for purchases with a price that exceeds 1.5 times the average order size for your store.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_od4tc9e2mx2g"></a>Putting it all together</h3>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4125" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve.png" alt="NS8 Approve" width="1552" height="609" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-200x78.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-300x118.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-400x157.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-600x235.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-768x301.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-800x314.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-1024x402.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve-1200x471.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08_approve.png 1552w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Once an order has made it through the gauntlet of the above order rules and has not been flagged as risky or automatically canceled, it is likely safe to approve. An approval order rule will auto-approve any orders that passed previous scrutiny and is still categorized as low-risk. Orders with a score corresponding to a medium or high level of risk will remain in Merchant Review and require further investigation.</p>
<p align="left">This order rule should always come very last in the rule hierarchy, so any additional custom rules need to be placed above this one.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4126" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules.png" alt="NS8 Order Rules" width="1515" height="398" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-200x53.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-300x79.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-400x105.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-600x158.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-768x202.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-800x210.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-1024x269.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules-1200x315.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09_order_rules.png 1515w" sizes="(max-width: 1515px) 100vw, 1515px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">When these order rules are implemented together, they should roughly appear like this. Don’t forget that order rules run from top to bottom, so your rule hierarchy is essential for proper functioning. If you have your own custom order rules in addition to the ones we have suggested above, be sure to integrate them into your workflow appropriately, or else they may not function as intended. Our best practices guide explains more about how to properly structure order rules based on what role they fill.</p>

<p>This is the list of all of the features that are currently available. It&#8217;s possible to save a pre-defined value, or use a customized one (just text, basically). Let&#8217;s actually add a new feature! Click on <strong>Add a new feature</strong>.<br />
Let&#8217;s just call it &#8220;New Feature&#8221;, and click save. We will reach the features list page, where we can view and edit the currently available features. Let&#8217;s click on our new one, then <strong>Add new Feature Value</strong>.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3994" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43.png" alt="" width="1033" height="539" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-200x104.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-300x157.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-400x209.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-600x313.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-768x401.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-800x417.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43-1024x534.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_12-01-43.png 1033w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value</strong> is the text that will represent the value for that feature. For example, for a pre-built computer, it could be the SSD capacity, like 128gb, 256gb, etc.<br />
<strong>URL </strong>is only used in conjunction with the Layered Navigation module, to have a specific link to access the product list, filtered by this value. <strong>Meta title</strong> is also exclusive to the module&#8217;s usage, and changes the page&#8217;s title according to the selection.<br />
Let&#8217;s add any value, then hit <strong>Save </strong>to be brought back to the features list. Let&#8217;s go back to Catalog, Products, and edit our product once more. If we click on Features now, we will see our new one at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3996" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07.png" alt="" width="1029" height="606" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-200x118.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-300x177.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-400x236.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-600x353.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-768x452.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-800x471.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07-1024x603.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-37-07.png 1029w" sizes="(max-width: 1029px) 100vw, 1029px" /></p>
<p>All of the features containing pre-defined values will have a dropdown, so let&#8217;s click on it and choose the value we just added. We can also, of course, use a customized value for any of these, but not both. When present, a custom value will always be displayed in place of any pre-defined one.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3997" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09.png" alt="" width="951" height="473" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09-200x99.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09-300x149.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09-400x199.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09-600x298.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09-768x382.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09-800x398.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-41-09.png 951w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Product Customization Fields</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s now take a look at customization. In thirty bees, it&#8217;s possible to set up one or more customization inputs, to allow the user to add any custom text or images to the products they are buying. This is incredibly useful, for example, if you sell t-shirt prints, or any kind of customizable objects like dog tags, engraved jewels, and so on. In the product&#8217;s back office, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Customization</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3998" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53.png" alt="" width="861" height="219" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53-200x51.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53-300x76.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53-400x102.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53-600x153.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53-768x195.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53-800x203.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-51-53.png 861w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" /></p>
<p>There is not much to see right now, because there are no fields added to the product. Let&#8217;s add one file field, and one text field, by setting both of the inputs to 1, then hitting <strong>Save and Stay</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4000" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07.png" alt="" width="848" height="386" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07-200x91.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07-300x137.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07-400x182.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07-600x273.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07-768x350.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07-800x364.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_17-57-07.png 848w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>We can now choose a label for each field, and whether or not it is required to add a value, or file. Bear in mind that a required field will prevent adding the product to the cart without a value added to it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4002" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-00-52.png" alt="" width="721" height="518" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-00-52-200x144.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-00-52-300x216.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-00-52-400x287.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-00-52-600x431.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-00-52.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></p>
<p>In the front office, customers will see this form, and will be able to save their information prior to buying the product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>If you sell goods that have technical specifications, or manuals, it&#8217;s sometimes not convenient to add all of the information in the product&#8217;s description. This is where attachments come in use, allowing us to add a downloadable file to any product, that can be viewed any time. As we will see in a later article in this series, if instead we want a product to actually consist in a downloadable file, then Virtual Products are a better choice. Attachments are available to anyone viewing the product page, at any given time.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4003" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02.png" alt="" width="873" height="490" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02-200x112.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02-300x168.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02-400x225.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02-600x337.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02-768x431.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02-800x449.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-09-02.png 873w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p>Adding an attachment is really easy: write a name for the file, then click <strong>Add File</strong> to upload it. The new file will appear in the <strong>Available Attachments</strong> tab. This tab lists all of the attachments in the shop, and is shared across all products. To add this one to this specific product just click <strong>Add</strong>, then save.<br />
A new box with the download link will appear at the end of the product page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4004" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-11-08.png" alt="" width="579" height="464" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-11-08-177x142.png 177w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-11-08-200x160.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-11-08-300x240.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-11-08-400x321.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-11-08.png 579w" sizes="(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>The shipping tab is useful to calculate the shipping cost for each product. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4005" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50.png" alt="" width="1037" height="625" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-200x121.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-300x181.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-400x241.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-600x362.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-768x463.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-800x482.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50-1024x617.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-29-50.png 1037w" sizes="(max-width: 1037px) 100vw, 1037px" /></p>
<p>We can set linear dimensions for the product, that will be taken into account if the carrier uses size limitations, as well as the weight, which is summed up for each cart to determine the weight range it falls into. We can also add a special fee in case the product is somehow more expensive/laborious to ship.<br />
Lastly, in the <strong>Carriers</strong> tab, we can set which carriers will be able to deliver this product. If none is selected, all of them will be available. It&#8217;s particularly important to check this tab whenever you get the &#8220;No carrier available&#8221; error message during the checkout, as it is likely to be the culprit of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>SEO</strong></h3>
<p>Last but not least, let&#8217;s take a look at the SEO option thirty bees has to offer, by clicking on the corresponding tab.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4006" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47.png" alt="" width="869" height="369" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47-200x85.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47-300x127.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47-400x170.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47-600x255.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47-768x326.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47-800x340.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_18-36-47.png 869w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
<p>Here we can choose a meaningful title and description, that will be displayed in the search results, as well as the &#8220;pretty url&#8221; for this product. It&#8217;s recommended to use meaningful keywords in all these fields, and keep them within the limits. As a side note, the Friendly URL will only be used when URL Rewriting is enabled in the SEO &amp; URLs settings page.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>At this point we have enough information to build a really solid product list. But wait! There is more. In the next article we will have a deeper look at Attributes and Combinations, a vast topic in and of itself!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we will have an overview of two special types of products thirty bees natively supports:  virtual products and products pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Virtual product type</h3>
<p>Virtual products are the go-to solution for anything that does not require shipping, and usually includes a file that can be downloaded as well. If you are familiar standard products, you might be wondering what&#8217;s the difference between attachments and virtual products: <strong>while attachments are always available, virtual products&#8217; files cannot be accessed before buying the product</strong>. This means virtual products are the ideal solution if you are selling software, plugins, or even ebooks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s set up a test virtual product to see how it all works. From the products list, let&#8217;s click <strong>Add new product</strong>.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3936" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16.png" alt="" width="1194" height="687" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-200x115.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-300x173.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-400x230.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-600x345.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-768x442.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-800x460.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16-1024x589.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-16-16.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></p>
<p>In the Information screen let&#8217;s choose Virtual Product as Type. Immediately, you will notice the Shipping and Combinations items on the left menu have disappeared. For obvious reasons, it&#8217;s not necessary to set up shipping for a virtual product (hence the name), but what about combinations? At the time being, virtual combinations are not supported in thirty bees out of the box, however if you are a developer and can handle possible exceptions and errors, you can try <a href="http://nemops.com/prestashop-virtual-products-combinations/#.XYbb6SgzaUk">this tutorial</a>, which works in thirty bees as well.</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s set up some basic information for the product, such as name, reference, and descriptions, leaving the other options as default, then hit <strong>Save and Stay</strong>:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3937" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09.png" alt="" width="856" height="744" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09-200x174.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09-300x261.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09-400x348.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09-600x521.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09-768x668.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09-800x695.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-34-09.png 856w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /></p>
<p>At  this point we can start thinking about the virtual good itself. We want to set up a downloadable file, so let&#8217;s click on <strong>Virtual Product</strong>, then set <strong>Does this product have an associated file?</strong> to yes.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3938" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19.png" alt="" width="889" height="745" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19-200x168.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19-300x251.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19-400x335.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19-600x503.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19-768x644.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19-800x670.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-38-19.png 889w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we can set up all of the options required for the file to be accessed at specific conditions.<br />
<strong>Is the file Active?</strong>: this option is useful if you temporarily want to disallow the file&#8217;s download on your customer&#8217;s end, while at the same time keeping a copy of it on the server.<br />
<strong>File:</strong> this is where we can upload the actual file people will have access to after buying the product. The size can be tweaked from <strong>Administration, Preferences:</strong><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30.png" alt="" width="1080" height="228" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-200x42.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-300x63.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-400x84.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-600x127.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-768x162.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-800x169.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30-1024x216.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-45-30.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>Back to the virtual product page, let&#8217;s click on Add File and choose a file to be uploaded. In my case it&#8217;s the default thirty bees theme.<br />
<strong>Filename:</strong> will automatically be populated, and I suggest not changing it, but rather the actual file name before uploading, unless you really have to.<br />
<strong>Number of allowed downloads:</strong> sets the maximum number of times the file can be downloaded, for each customer.<br />
<strong>Expiration date:</strong> is useful for products you don&#8217;t want to be accessible forever. After this date, the product download will be disabled for everyone, regardless of when they purchased it.<br />
<strong>Number of days: </strong>differs with the above in that it allows a certain number of days after the purchase for the product to be downloaded. This will be different for each customer.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave the options as default, then click on <strong>Prices</strong> and set any non-zero price for this item. Also, let&#8217;s set the quantity in the quantity tab to anything above zero. Then click Save and Stay:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3940" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48.png" alt="" width="1104" height="464" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-200x84.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-300x126.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-400x168.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-600x252.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-768x323.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-800x336.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48-1024x430.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_11-52-48.png 1104w" sizes="(max-width: 1104px) 100vw, 1104px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3943" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45.png" alt="" width="1083" height="516" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-200x95.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-300x143.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-400x191.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-600x286.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-768x366.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-800x381.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45-1024x488.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_19-31-45.png 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 1083px) 100vw, 1083px" /></p>
<p>The product is ready to be tested! Of course, all of the options available for Standard Products can be set for Virtual ones as well (such as  images, features and so on), but right away we can see if the settings are working and the file can be successfully downloaded. To do so let&#8217;s click <strong>preview</strong> in the top right to reach the product, then buy it using any payment method, set the order to <strong>Payment Accepted</strong> in the order manager, and reach the customer&#8217;s order in the front office:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3945" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46.png" alt="" width="1164" height="529" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-200x91.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-300x136.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-400x182.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-600x273.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-768x349.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-800x364.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46-1024x465.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-42-46.png 1164w" sizes="(max-width: 1164px) 100vw, 1164px" /></p>
<p>The virtual product will have a link icon so that it can be downloaded, according to the settings!</p>
<h3>The Pack of Existing Products type</h3>
<p>The Pack of Existing Products type, or simply &#8220;Pack product&#8221;, is a collection of other products that are already available in the store. Packs cannot contain virtual products, but only standard types, which also need to have a specific combination set (when present). Let&#8217;s see how to set up one!</p>
<p>From the main &#8220;Add a new product&#8221; page, let&#8217;s check <strong>Pack of existing products</strong> as type. The Combinations tab will disappear, and a new field will pop up in the Information tab:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3947" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07.png" alt="" width="909" height="527" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07-200x116.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07-300x174.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07-400x232.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07-600x348.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07-768x445.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07-800x464.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_21-53-07.png 909w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></p>
<p>As soon as we start inputting a product name in the new input, a list of matching available products will drop down. Let&#8217;s choose one, then click on <strong>Add this product, </strong>and repeat for another one.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19.png" alt="" width="1058" height="763" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-200x144.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-300x216.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-400x288.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-600x433.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-768x554.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-800x577.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19-1024x738.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-01-19.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s choose a name, and hit Save and Stay. It&#8217;s important to notice two things: product quantities cannot be chosen once the product is added to a pack, so it will have to be removed, and re-added if that&#8217;s what we need. Secondly, and most importantly, the quantities cannot be changed or chosen by customers in the front office.  Before testing, let&#8217;s make sure it has a price, as well as a quantity that is more than 0.<br />
With regards to quantity handling, Packs offer us several options to choose from:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3949" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35.png" alt="" width="1078" height="636" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-200x118.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-300x177.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-400x236.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-600x354.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-768x453.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-800x472.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35-1024x604.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-05-35.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
<p>If we want the single components&#8217; quantities to be reduced, we can choose the first option for <strong>available quantities</strong>. This will disable the pack in case one or more products it includes are out of stock. This option, however, is only available when using advanced stock management, and cannot be selected without it.<br />
Next, we can choose what to do when a pack is purchased:<br />
&#8211; We can reduce the pack&#8217;s quantity (that is set below)<br />
&#8211; We can reduce the quantity for single products inside the pack<br />
&#8211; We can reduce both</p>
<p>By default, only the pack&#8217;s quantity can be reduced. For this example, let&#8217;s set Quantity to any value above 0, like 10, and hit Save and Stay.</p>
<p>As soon as we test in the front office, we will see the Pack Content tab is populated with the products we chose. It&#8217;s also important to notice the customer will be able to see how much he is saving by buying the pack, directly below the pack&#8217;s price.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3952" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23.png" alt="" width="789" height="930" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23-200x236.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23-255x300.png 255w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23-400x471.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23-600x707.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23-768x905.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-22_22-11-23.png 789w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In part one of this mini-series, we will go through all you need to know in order to add new products in thirty bees.</p>
<h3>Basic Product Information</h3>
<p>In thirty bees, we can create a new product directly from the products list. Let&#8217;s access it by clicking on <strong>Catalog</strong> from the left hand menu.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3963" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28.png" alt="" width="863" height="827" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28-200x192.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28-300x287.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28-400x383.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28-600x575.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28-768x736.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28-800x767.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_17-25-28.png 863w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p>This page lists all of the products added to the shop, both enabled and disabled. The list can be filtered by category, using the yellow button above it, or various properties for each product, through the search filter.<br />
Let&#8217;s create a new one! Click on the large <strong>Add a new product </strong> button on the top right.</p>

<p>The first page we are presented with will contain all of the basic information for this product. Let&#8217;s go through the fields one by one.<br />
<strong>Type:</strong> thirty bees natively supports three types of products: Standard, Virtual, and Pack. We will have an in depth look at the other two in the next article, so for now <strong>let&#8217;s leave it set to Standard.</strong><br />
<strong>Name:</strong> as the label suggests, this field contains the actual product name, used to identify it in both the front and back office. This field is required.<br />
<strong>Reference code:</strong> this text will be displayed alongside the product name in the single product page, as well as the product lists for each order. It usually contains some unique reference code that might help you identify the product when shipping.<br />
<strong>EAN-13 or JAN barcode / UPC barcode:</strong> these fields should contain eventual barcodes for your products, especially if you sell books.<br />
<strong>Enabled: </strong>a product that is enabled will be visible in the shop, but not necessarily available for purchase. If we set it to No, the product&#8217;s url will not be accessible, and we can choose what to do with that page: either spawn a 404 not found, a temporary redirect, or a permanent redirect. This is particularly useful for products that have been discontinued, but are still indexed by search engines.<br />
<strong>Options:</strong> these are various options for when a product is enabled. We can choose whether or not to make it available for purchase, whether or not to show the price (which must be enabled if people can purchase it) and if we want to display a special badge on the product&#8217;s picture, stating it&#8217;s only being sold in your online shop.<br />
<strong>Condition: </strong> this is rarely used, unless you have listings that are either used or new, but cannot be both and chosen by the client (choice for which combinations, that we will see later, are much better).<br />
<strong>Short Description:</strong> is a shorter paragraph of text that will be displayed in the product list and at the top of the single product page.<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> is the full text listing all of the product&#8217;s details, displayed on the single product page.<br />
<strong>Tags:</strong> are keywords used to identify the product in some way, and come in handy only when used in conjunction with the tags Block Module, enabling the customer to list, for example, all products that are related to the word &#8220;laptop&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s fill the various fields with generic information, leaving the options as default, and click <strong>Save And Stay</strong>.</p>
<p>Great! The product is now created, and can already be accessed from the front office. Let&#8217;s click <strong>Preview</strong> at the top:<br />

<p>It doesn&#8217;t look so good without a price and images, does it? Let&#8217;s spice it up!</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Price and Images</h3>
<p>Back to our Admin page, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Prices</strong> on the inner  left menu.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3969" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00.png" alt="" width="1194" height="963" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-177x142.png 177w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-200x161.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-300x242.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-400x323.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-600x484.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-768x619.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-800x645.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00-1024x826.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_18-55-00.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></p>
<p>Starting from the top, we have <strong>Wholesale Price</strong>, which is only used internally for calculating your revenue, as it is the price your bought the product at, from the supplier; then <strong>Retail Price</strong> is the base price that will be displayed in the front office to the customer. Let&#8217;s set this one to something like 20. This price will be increased according to what is set in the <strong>Tax Rule</strong> box, in this case 4%. When clicking on the tax rule select, you will see a list of the available tax rules, that has been pre-populated based on the country chosen when installing thirty bees. Of course, these can be modified and new ones can be created.<br />
<strong>Unit Price</strong> is purely informational, and displays the price per unit in the front office. For example, if you are selling a crate with 6 bottles, you can show the customer how much each bottle will cost.</p>
<p>The <strong>Specific Prices</strong> area is used to create discounts specifically for this product.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3970" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54.png" alt="" width="974" height="695" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54-200x143.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54-300x214.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54-400x285.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54-600x428.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54-768x548.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54-800x571.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-01-54.png 974w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /><br />
We can add static discounts or percentage ones, based on various options such as currency, country, customer group, date, or even create a special price for a single customer. We don&#8217;t really need them for a single product, so let&#8217;s just click on <strong>Images</strong> in the left menu.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3974" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34.png" alt="" width="1005" height="430" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34-200x86.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34-300x128.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34-400x171.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34-600x257.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34-768x329.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34-800x342.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-10-34.png 1005w" sizes="(max-width: 1005px) 100vw, 1005px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s click on <strong>Add files&#8230;</strong> to choose an image for this product, write a meaningful <strong>Caption</strong>, then click <strong>Upload Files</strong>. The new image/s will appear in the tab below. Let&#8217;s click <strong>Save and Stay</strong> again, then Preview to see what the product looks like now:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3975" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51.png" alt="" width="812" height="641" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51-200x158.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51-300x237.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51-400x316.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51-600x474.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51-768x606.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51-800x632.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-12-51.png 812w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></p>
<p>Better! But wait, there are two issues. First, you can see there is no Add to Cart, because the product currently has 0 set as quantity. The second is that the product cannot be reached, unless a customer uses the search function, or we are using the homepage featured products module. Let&#8217;s add some stock, as well as a category for it.</p>
<h3>Categories and Quantities</h3>
<p>Back to the previous page, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Associations</strong>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3976" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44.png" alt="" width="1195" height="549" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-200x92.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-300x138.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-400x184.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-600x276.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-768x353.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-800x368.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44-1024x470.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_19-14-44.png 1195w" sizes="(max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px" /></p>
<p>This is where we can set the category, or categories, for the product. The interface is really easy to use: just check the box next to the category. Right now only Home is selected, and by default, in a new installation, the Featured Products module will take care of displaying the Home category products, in the homepage of course. I will assign this product to Coffee and Tea , then also set its <strong>Default Category</strong> to it. The default category is where the products are displayed by default, and inherit discounts and visibility from.<br />
<strong>Accessories </strong>are not necessary for our simple product, but just so you know, they display products that are related to this main one, such as a phone cover could be to a smartphone product.<br />
<strong>Manufacturer</strong> can be used to indicate extra information about the product&#8217;s make, such as Apple, or Samsung. Manufacturers can be added through as separate interface as well.</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Quantities:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3979" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07.png" alt="" width="1183" height="1131" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-200x191.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-300x287.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-400x382.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-600x574.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-768x734.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-800x765.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07-1024x979.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-43-07.png 1183w" sizes="(max-width: 1183px) 100vw, 1183px" /></p>
<p>This interface might be confusing, but unless you want to use Advanced Stock Management (with warehouses, and more), then only setting that really matters is <strong>Quantity: </strong>let&#8217;s change it to something larger than 0.<br />
<strong>When out of stock</strong> determines the product&#8217;s behavior when the quantity is 0. Right now it&#8217;s set to deny orders, and that is why we did not get an Add to Cart button in the front page. If we do allow ordering this product when it is not in stock, we can set some custom text below, in the <strong>Availability Settings</strong> tab. We can choose the minimum amount of units that can be purchased, what the text should read if it&#8217;s on preorder or backorder, and eventually when this product will be available. All we really needed was setting the quantity in any case, so let&#8217;s save and stay, then check the front office, first the category:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3982" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1.png" alt="" width="957" height="477" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1-200x100.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1-300x150.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1-400x199.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1-600x299.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1-768x383.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1-800x399.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-23_21-50-58-1.png 957w" sizes="(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px" /></p>
<p>Then the product page:</p>

Awesome! The product is ready to be sold!</p>
<p>This is everything for part one. In the next installment we will explore some more in-depth options, to take our products&#8217; characteristics to the next level!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s article we will explore how to manage wholesale customers, and create targeted products, pricing, and more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Creating a wholesale customer group</h3>
<p>The first step is to create a customer group to hold all of the wholesale customers. From the main menu, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Customers</strong>, then <strong>Groups</strong>.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3913" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06.png" alt="" width="1113" height="577" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-200x104.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-300x156.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-400x207.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-600x311.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-768x398.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-800x415.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_17-55-06.png 1113w" sizes="(max-width: 1113px) 100vw, 1113px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s add a new one! In the next tab we can choose the options for this new Group. Apart from calling it Wholesale, I will leave all of the options as default. As you can see, it&#8217;s possible to apply a global discount on all products for members of this group. This is not what we want for now, but feel free to experiment.</p>

<p>After saving the new group, we need to assign a customer to it so that we can test, of course! let&#8217;s hop to <strong>Customers</strong>, <strong>Customers</strong>, and click on any of them in the list.</p>

<p>Scroll down till you see Groups, and click Edit.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3916" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-04-43.png" alt="" width="766" height="663" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-04-43-200x173.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-04-43-300x260.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-04-43-400x346.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-04-43-600x519.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-04-43.png 766w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>Tick the box next to the new Wholesale group, set it as default, and hit save.</p>
<h3>Creating a limited access category</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to <strong>Catalog, Categories, </strong>then click <strong>Add a new category</strong> in the top right. Let&#8217;s give it some basic info, such as title, description, and so on, then from the bottom <strong>Group Access</strong> block, <strong>uncheck everything apart from Wholesale</strong>, and save.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3918" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44.png" alt="" width="917" height="676" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44-200x147.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44-300x221.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44-400x295.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44-600x442.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44-768x566.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44-800x590.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-13-44.png 917w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /></p>
<p>The new category has been created, but it&#8217;s not visible in the front office yet, so let&#8217;s add it to the top menu. Let&#8217;s reach the modules list, look for &#8220;top menu&#8221; and click <strong>Configure</strong> next to <strong>Block Top Menu</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3919" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39.png" alt="" width="1202" height="222" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-200x37.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-300x55.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-400x74.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-600x111.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-768x142.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-800x148.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-1024x189.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39-1200x222.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-15-39.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px" /></p>
<p>Find <strong>Wholesale</strong> in the category list, add it, and save.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3920" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04.png" alt="" width="788" height="326" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04-200x83.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04-300x124.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04-400x165.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04-600x248.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04-768x318.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-18-04.png 788w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>Access the back office and&#8230; wait a minute! No category?<br />
If you don&#8217;t see the category in the front office, then it&#8217;s working exactly as expected. In order to see it, you must be logged in as a wholesale customer. If you can see it and are not logged in, check the access settings from the category menu again.</p>
<p>What is a category without products though? Let&#8217;s reach the product catalog and create a new product (or edit an existing one). In the <strong>Associations</strong> tab, make sure only Wholesale is selected and set as default category, then hit save.</p>
<p>This product will now be hidden from all non-wholesale products, both visually and direct access. If you try to access either the category or product without being part of the group, an error message will be shown:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3923" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-27-32-1.png" alt="" width="620" height="280" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-27-32-1-200x90.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-27-32-1-300x135.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-27-32-1-400x181.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-27-32-1-600x271.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-27-32-1.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a discount for wholesale customers</h3>
<p>Remember when we created the Wholesale group, but did not add a discount? The reason for that is that we have a method that gives us more flexibility when creating price reductions for customer groups. Let&#8217;s hop to <strong>Price Rules</strong>, <strong>Catalog Price Rules</strong>, then click the plus icon to add a new one.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3924" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08.png" alt="" width="997" height="738" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08-200x148.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08-300x222.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08-400x296.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08-600x444.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08-768x568.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08-800x592.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-32-08.png 997w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that, in addition to having access to specific products, our Wholesale Customers also get a 10% discount on everything. With a catalog price rule, setting it up is a piece of cake. Let&#8217;s call the new rule <strong>Wholesale Discount</strong>, set the group to Wholesale, reduction type <strong>Percentage</strong>, and reduction set to 10.<br />
The new rule will take effect as soon as it&#8217;s saved, and the result will only affect logged in Wholesale Customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3925" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43.png" alt="" width="889" height="368" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43-200x83.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43-300x124.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43-400x166.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43-600x248.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43-768x318.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43-800x331.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-39-43.png 889w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you don&#8217;t see the new pricing appear, head over to Advanced Parameters, Performance, and clear the site&#8217;s cache using the button in the top right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Displaying specific payment methods/modules for wholesale only</h3>
<p>In addition to having specific access and pricing, let&#8217;s say our Wholesale group also has a dedicated payment module available. Setting up a module (a payment module in this case) to be accessible only by specific customer groups is really easy. let&#8217;s go back to <strong>Customers</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong>. We want <strong>Bankwire</strong> to only be available for Wholesale, so what we can do is access all of the other groups by clicking <strong>Edit</strong>, and set it not to be authorized:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3927" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09.png" alt="" width="1137" height="389" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-200x68.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-300x103.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-400x137.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-600x205.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-768x263.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-800x274.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09-1024x350.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-45-09.png 1137w" sizes="(max-width: 1137px) 100vw, 1137px" /></p>
<p>The Bankwire module will now be hidden to everyone apart from the Wholesale customers!</p>

<p>Today we will have a deeper look at customer accounts in thirty bees. We will see how to set them up from the back office and customize the shopping experience for them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Creating customer accounts from the Back Office in thirty bees</h3>



<p>In thirty bees, customers can of course register their new account either by checking out or by manually reaching the registration page in the front office. There are times when merchants need to create accounts for their customers too though, such as for those who accept phone orders, or offer any other kind of indirect shopping experience. thirty bees makes it really easy, so let&#8217;s get to it!<br />To create a new customer from the Back Office, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Customers</strong>, then <strong>Add new customer</strong>.</p>

<p>The next page allows us to choose all of the options a customer can select in the front office, and more.</p>

<p>All of the fields down to Enabled certainly need no explanation, but here is what the others do:<br /><strong>Enabled</strong>: A customer might be enabled or disabled at any time. When disabled, he or she will not be able to login.<br /><strong>Newsletter:</strong> like the front office box, it&#8217;s whether or not this customer will receive your newsletter.<br /><strong>Opt-in:</strong> similar to Newsletter, it sets if the customer will receive ads and your partners&#8217; (if any) offers via email.<br /><strong>Language</strong>: sets the front office language for this customer.<br /><br /><strong>Group Access</strong> needs particular attention. Each customer can be assigned to one or more groups, that entitle them to receive particular offers, see specific categories, or use specific payment methods. By default, all users visiting our shop are <strong>Visitors</strong>. If we enable Guest Checkout, allowing people to buy without an actual account, after adding his information the visitor will become<strong> Guest</strong>. Lastly, by default, someone who registers will be put in the <strong>Customer</strong> group. <br />The <strong>Default customer group</strong> is important to decide which discount should be applied to the customer if he belongs to more than one group (the default one will).<br /><br />It&#8217;s possible to create other groups of course, but we will see this, and more, in a future tutorial.<br /><br />For now, let&#8217;s add name, email, password, and leave group access as per default, then save.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Now that the customer has been created, it will be possible to login to the front office using the email address/password chosen in the form. An email will be sent to the address too, containing all of the necessary information.</p>



<p>In order to be able to create a cart for him or her, an address is necessary. Let&#8217;s click on the new customer in the list to see the detail page:</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-3884" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28-200x191.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28-300x286.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28-400x381.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28-600x572.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28-768x732.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28-800x762.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-21-28.png 979w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></figure>



<p>This page contains a summary of all of the activity and date pertaining this customer.<br />By clicking edit, we can change the information we added just a while ago, but what we need to do now is add an address, so let&#8217;s click on the bottom-most link on the page.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-3885" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35.png" alt="" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35-200x216.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35-278x300.png 278w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35-400x432.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35-600x648.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35-768x829.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35-800x864.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-26-35.png 803w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<p><br />Here we can add the customer&#8217;s address, basically like anyone would do in the front office. Add anything, and click save.<br /><br />The customer is now ready to shop! Of course if you are accepting phone orders, at this point you can create a new order from the back office as well, so that the customer will just have to wait for his package to arrive!</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Adding targeted discounts</h3>



<p>One of the neatest features of thirty bees is the possibility of adding targeted discounts for specific customer accounts.<br /><br />From the main menu, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Price Rules</strong>, then <strong>Cart Rules</strong>. This is how discounts are named in thirty bees.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-3886" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43-66x66.png 66w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43-150x150.png 150w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43-200x199.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43-300x298.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43-400x397.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-29-43.png 589w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></figure>



<p>From the right hand side, click on <strong>Add a new Cart Rule</strong>.<br />Set the values as the screenshot (any code will do, but <strong>make sure highlight is set to yes</strong>), then click <strong>Conditions</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-3889" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45.png" alt="" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-200x101.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-300x152.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-400x202.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-540x272.png 540w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-600x304.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-768x389.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45-800x405.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-53-45.png 996w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start typing the name of the customer in the field, then set any value for the cart rule, making sure the dates are valid and the current day is within range. Ideally, for this test it&#8217;s better to leave all of the rest as default.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-3888" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56.png" alt="" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56-200x109.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56-300x164.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56-400x218.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56-600x327.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56-768x419.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56-800x436.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-16_19-39-56.png 996w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></figure>



<p>Lastly, in the Actions tab, let&#8217;s set something easy to spot, like a 50% reduction, and hit save.<br /><br />This will create a discount targeted to that specific customer, and him alone, and nobody else will be able to take advantage of the offer. This is great to create special offers for customers that meet specific criteria, or reward high value orders.<br /><br />From now on, the customer will be able to access his discounts from the account menu, clicking on <strong>My Vouchers</strong>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we will see how to set up shipping in thirty bees, and what kind of options we have to customize and fine tune carriers and prices.</p>
<h2>Preparing products</h2>
<p>Before messing with any shipping options, it&#8217;s important to understand that many of the carrier settings will be affected by how each product&#8217;s shipping options are configured. Let&#8217;s access a product, and tab to &#8220;Shipping&#8221;:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3844" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25.png" alt="" width="1430" height="697" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-200x97.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-300x146.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-400x195.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-600x292.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-768x374.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-800x390.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-1024x499.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25-1200x585.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-26-25.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px" /></p>
<p>The first three options are seldom used without third party modules, as the standard carrier system only considers each item&#8217;s size for the limits, rather than summing them all up, so we can freely skip them.<br />
The package Weight, on the other hand, is very important. As we will see, it&#8217;s possible to set up a shipping method&#8217;s cost to be based on weight, that is the total weight of the order. All products&#8217; weights will be summed up, and the total will be considered when calculating the shipping cost.<br />
It&#8217;s also possible to add an extra cost for each item, meaning that whatever we enter here will be multiplied by the number of items in the cart, and added to the shipping cost.<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>Carriers</strong> tab is where merchants often get confused. This tab allows us to select specific carriers for each product, effectively disabling all of the others. This is useful if you have some carriers that ship overseas, but a product is too large or too heavy to be. When no carrier is selected in this tab, all of them will be available.<br />
Bear in mine that all carriers under&nbsp;<strong>Available Carriers</strong> will NOT be available for this product, while instead all of the ones under&nbsp;<strong>Selected Carriers</strong> will.</p>
<p>For the time being, I will set the item&#8217;s weight to 1kg, and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setting up a weight based carrier</h2>
<p>Now that we have at least one product to play with, let&#8217;s create a new carrier and see how to set up shipping based on the cart&#8217;s weight.<br />
From the side menu, let&#8217;s click on <strong>Shipping</strong>, then <strong>Carriers</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3846" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24.png" alt="" width="1061" height="467" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-200x88.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-300x132.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-400x176.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-600x264.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-768x338.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-800x352.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24-1024x451.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-36-24.png 1061w" sizes="(max-width: 1061px) 100vw, 1061px" /></p>
<p>The first screen of the carrier wizard will contain some basic information about this shipping method:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3847" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32.png" alt="" width="1062" height="744" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-200x140.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-300x210.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-400x280.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-600x420.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-768x538.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-800x560.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32-1024x717.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_18-39-32.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /></p>
<p>Both <strong>Carrier Name</strong> and <strong>Transit Time</strong> are used mainly in the front office to inform your customers about what they are choosing as shipping method.<br />
<strong>Speed grade</strong>, on the other hand, is used internally to sort the carriers in case the specific option is selected within the carrier preferences.<br />
Of course, can can add the shipping company&#8217;s logo, as well as their url for tracking the order once it ships.<br />
This last parameter is very important, and we should always remember to add the <strong>&#8220;@&#8221;</strong> sign wherever the tracking number should appear. For example, if the tracking url for the company is http://fedex.com/track?num=, then we would have to write&nbsp;<strong>http://fedex.com/track?num=@</strong>. Failing to do so will make it impossible for the customer to check his order status on the carrier&#8217;s website, so always double-check the setting.</p>
<p>Once done, let&#8217;s click &#8220;next&#8221; and access the Shipping Locations and Costs page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3849" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46.png" alt="" width="1053" height="855" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-200x162.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-300x244.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-400x325.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-600x487.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-768x624.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-800x650.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46-1024x831.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-08_19-39-46.png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 1053px) 100vw, 1053px" /></p>
<p>This is where the juice of the system comes into play.<br />
First, we can choose if this carrier has some additional handling fees, which can be set up in the carrier preferences. They are the same for all carrier since they are supposed to represent the cost of your own shipping process, regardless of the chosen carrier.<br />
When Free Shipping is set to yes, the carrier will always be free, regardless of the ranges defined below. Tax is pretty self-explanatory too, and allows us to apply a specific tax to the carrier cost.<br />
<strong>Out-of-range</strong> behavior is what&#8217;s going to happen should the cart&#8217;s value exceed the settings. We can choose to completely disable the carrier, or apply the highest possible cost.<br />
Also notice I left the&nbsp;<strong>Billing</strong> option set to &#8220;According to total Weight&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3851" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-14-07.png" alt="" width="576" height="635" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-14-07-200x220.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-14-07-272x300.png 272w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-14-07-400x441.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-14-07.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ranges&nbsp;</strong>are by far the most important part of this tab. Here we can set prices and zone availability for the carrier. All of the names on t he left represent&nbsp;<strong>Zones</strong>, that can be configured from the back office, accessing&nbsp;<strong>Localization &gt; Zones</strong>. You can think of a zone as a macro area containing countries, very useful for setting shipping carriers for more than one country at the time.<br />
Back to the ranges, in the example above I have set the carrier to only ship to North America, charging $5 for weights up to 10 kg, and $10 for anything between 10 and 20. The out-of-range behavior was set to &#8220;Apply the cost of the highest range&#8221;, so that anything exceeding 20 kg will still be charged $10.</p>
<p>The next page contains various options for limiting the carrier&#8217;s availability.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3852" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43.png" alt="" width="1089" height="644" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-200x118.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-300x177.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-400x237.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-600x355.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-768x454.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-800x473.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43-1024x606.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-18-43.png 1089w" sizes="(max-width: 1089px) 100vw, 1089px" /></p>
<p><strong>Group Access</strong> is probably the only option we will ever use, as it allows to hide the carrier from specific customer groups. This is particularly handy if we have a wholesale group that has specific shipping methods assigned to it, that need to be hidden for regular customers.<br />
Then, in the last tab, is a summary of all of the previous options.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just hit &#8220;finish&#8221; to create the new carrier, which will appear in the carriers list.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3853" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10.png" alt="" width="1094" height="497" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-200x91.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-300x136.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-400x182.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-600x273.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-768x349.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-800x363.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10-1024x465.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-23-10.png 1094w" sizes="(max-width: 1094px) 100vw, 1094px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s run a quick test! I set the product to weigh 1kg, so we will get a shipping cost of $5 for 9 units, and $10 for anything above 10 units.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3854" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-34-38.gif" alt="" width="1176" height="418"></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Setting up a price based carrier</h2>
<p>The process of setting up a price based carrier is very similar to the weight based one, except for the&nbsp;<strong>Billing</strong> option in the second tab. Let&#8217;s try it! I will go back to the Carriers list, and click&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong> next to the carrier I just created, tab to Shipping and Locations, and change it as follows:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3856" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-40-05.png" alt="" width="559" height="776" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-40-05-200x278.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-40-05-216x300.png 216w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-40-05-400x555.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-40-05.png 559w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></p>
<p>I will charge $8 for anything under a hundred dollars, and make the shipping free above that.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3857" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-43-10.gif" alt="" width="1160" height="436"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Carrier Preferences</h2>
<p>Lastly, let&#8217;s click on Carrier &gt; Preferences. From this page we can set up a variety of options to control the carriers globally:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3858" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24.png" alt="" width="1070" height="866" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-177x142.png 177w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-200x162.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-300x243.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-400x324.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-600x486.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-768x622.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-800x647.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24-1024x829.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-09_10-44-24.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Handling Charges:</strong> This controls how much to add to each carrier&#8217;s cost in case you have processing costs.<br />
<strong>Free shipping starts at $/kg:</strong> This&nbsp; setting will override each carrier&#8217;s configuration, and just make everything over a certain price or weight free.</p>
<p>Lastly, the carrier options are used to sort shipping options in the checkout.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a merchant, it is important to have a streamlined process to handle order submissions, to facilitate the shipping process and deliver as quickly as possible. Let’s have an in depth look at thirty bees’ order statuses’ inner workings and see how they can help us organize and ship orders in the most efficient possible<br />
manner.</p>
<h2>What is an order status?</h2>
<p>To understand what statuses are, let’s reach the Orders page in the back office to start with.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3808" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13.png" alt="" width="1190" height="505" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-200x85.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-300x127.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-400x170.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-600x255.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-768x326.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-800x339.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-940x400.png 940w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13-1024x435.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-44-13.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px" /></p>
<p>What reads under the <strong>Status</strong> heading represents the state the order is currently in, and it’s meant to inform both the merchant and customer about how the order process is continuing after it’s been placed. Is there any action needed on the customer’s end? Or should the merchant take action instead? Has there been an error with the payment method? These are all questions Order Statuses are meant to answer.<br />
Some of them are automatically triggered by the system, while others must be set by the employee processing orders in the back office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The order Status Panel</h2>
<p>Let’s now have a look at what the default statuses are. Click on <strong>Orders</strong>, then <strong>Statuses. </strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3807" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48.png" alt="" width="1177" height="916" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-200x156.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-300x233.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-400x311.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-600x467.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-768x598.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-800x623.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48-1024x797.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_10-35-48.png 1177w" sizes="(max-width: 1177px) 100vw, 1177px" /></p>
<p>This is a complete list of the statuses available in the shop. <strong>In a standard installation there are thirteen default statuses</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Payment accepted</strong>: usually set by payment modules that process standard payments (like credit cards).</p>
<p><strong>Processing in Progress</strong>: set by the merchant once the order is evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>Shipped</strong>: set by the merchant once the order has been shipped.</p>
<p><strong>Delivered</strong>: seldom used without automation.</p>
<p><strong>Canceled</strong>: set by the merchant upon cancellation, restores product stock.</p>
<p><strong>Refunded</strong>: usually set by the merchant after cancelling an order. It’s also set by modules that include an automated refund button.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Error</strong>: automatically triggered when a payment processor encounters trouble and the payment is refused.</p>
<p><strong>On Backorder (paid)</strong>: set in place of Payment Accepted when the products ordered are out of stock.</p>
<p><strong>Awaiting Bankwire Payment</strong>: specific to the Bankwire module, it’s the default status for an order placed using that payment method.</p>
<p><strong>Awaiting Paypal Payment</strong>: specific to the default Paypal module, it’s the default status for an order placed using that payment method, and it’s set while the payment is being processed if any delay occurs. Seldom used.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Payment Accepted</strong>: seldom used, very similar to payment accepted, can be used to differentiate from it if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>On Backorder (not paid)</strong>: set when an out of stock product is ordered, but the order has not been paid for yet (like for bankwire)</p>
<p><strong>Awaiting Cash On Delivery Validation</strong>: specific to the COD module, it’s the default status for an order placed using that payment method.</p>
<p>Any status following these has been created either manually or by a module. While <strong>default Order Statuses cannot be erased</strong>, as they are integral part of the system, custom ones can be. It’s strongly recommended not to do it in any case, unless the module they refer to  has been completely removed.</p>
<p>Order Status Options</p>
<p>Each status has several configurable options, that can be changed at any time and for each one of them, including default statuses.<br />
Let’s click on <strong>Payment Accepted</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3809" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15.png" alt="" width="1171" height="726" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-200x124.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-300x186.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-400x248.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-600x372.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-768x476.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-800x496.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15-1024x635.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-11-15.png 1171w" sizes="(max-width: 1171px) 100vw, 1171px" /></p>
<p>From this panel we can customize every aspect of a status. While Name, Icon and Color are pretty obvious settings, let’s go through some of the other important ones.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the associated order as validated:</strong> this tells the system that an order set to this status is considered valid and paid. The products’ stock will be taken from your inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Set the order as shipped</strong>: if this is ticked, after setting an order to this status, it won’t be possible to make changes to its content anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Set the order as paid</strong>: adds the order value to the revenue statistics in the dashboard, and generates an invoice for it.</p>
<p><strong>Show delivery PDF:</strong> creates a delivery slip. It’s usually enabled for the Shipped status.</p>
<p><strong>Status is active for orders: </strong>sets whether or not this order status can be chosen for an order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, we have a box to select an email template. This is the template that will be used in case the “<strong>Send an email to the customer when his/her order status has changed”</strong> option is ticked.<br />
There are a variety of default templates, that can be edited through the <strong>Translations </strong> panel, but should you need a specific one, it’s always possible to copy an existing template, rename the .txt and .html files in the mails/*language iso code* folder, and use it as a new entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Manually processing Orders in thirty bees</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s now see how the whole system works, and how we can improve the workflow.<br />
An order just came in, it was paid by Bankwire, so we have to wait for our bank to notify us about a new payment. This is what we will see in the Order View page.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3810" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-40-24.png" alt="" width="684" height="397" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-40-24-200x116.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-40-24-300x174.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-40-24-400x232.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-40-24-600x348.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-01_11-40-24.png 684w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, after the payment is confirmed, we can set the payment to accepted. To do so, let’s click on the dropdown now reading “Awaiting bank wire payment”, select <strong>Payment Accepted</strong> from the list, and click <strong>Update Status</strong>.</p>

<p>Easy! Now since we have a fast turnaround, and want the customer to know we are taking care of his order, we can immediately set the status to <strong>Processing in progress</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s very important to be transparent with your customers, and let them know about any change in their order status.</p>
<p>Once we are done, and the package is on its way, we can set the order to Shipped. <strong>Before doing this</strong>, remember you can set a tracking number, for the customer to be able to follow their order on the carrier’s website, right below the order status panel:</p>

<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that’s all about order Statuses! As mentioned, all of this manual process can be automated, so that the system itself, together with payment processors and carriers APIs, can take care of setting the order statuses. Stay tuned for the next article, where we will see how the official <strong>Stripe Module</strong> can be set up to handle different order statuses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past 6 months I have mentioned that we have thought about pulling the plug on Patreon and moving to an in house system. Now is that time, we are finally ready to put Patreon to rest and move over to a better system for the future of thirty bees. Something more flexible, something that we can control more. Something were we control the data and users do not get randomly banned for what their store might be selling.</p>
<h2>The new system</h2>
<p>We are replacing Patreon with a function of our forum. This is going to allow us to better manage our supporters and provide more value for the support they provide us. Over the last few months we have tried to automate as many of the processes in our development flow as possible. Being a small team, this is essential to us being able to put out reliable software, without wasting a lot of hours actually building distributions of the software. Moving to an in house system for our supporters, we are able to utilize a script that will always keep our supporters file updated, without one of us having to manually update the file.</p>
<p>It will also allow us to add flare to the supporters on the forum to show everyone that you support the thirty bees project. Not to mention that the new system will also allow us to accept support at lower rates, so more of the community&#8217;s money makes it to thirty bees so we can press forward with our ideas.</p>
<p>Another aspect of moving to an in house platform is that it allows use to control your data better. In the past several months we have had a number of supporters who were removed from PAtreon for different reasons. Managing in house we will no longer have this problem. Plus, you will not be sharing your data with anyone other than us, that is a win-win situation.</p>
<h2>How to sign up</h2>
<p>I am in the process of changing out all of the links over the next couple days. But if you want to sign up to support thirty bees, there is a new page in the forum in which you can. <strong><a href="https://forum.thirtybees.com/support-thirty-bees/">Here is the new link to help support thirty bees. </a></strong> From here you can select which support level you want to support thirty bees at and sign up. Depending on your support level you will get different forum flare on our forum. You will also get access to a special forum for supporters only, since it is not public, we are more free to talk about the future of thirty bees and other things that might be of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always, we would like to thank our community, with out you all thirty bees would not be possible. We hope you all love the things we are doing with thirty bees to make it the most stable, secure ecommerce system in the world.</p>
